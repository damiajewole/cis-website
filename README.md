# cis-website
A website for the Computer and Information Sciences department of my university.
Note: Alhough I was the head of the team, this was all teamwork.
Demilade Sodimu created the Home and About Us page while I did the Blog and Faculty page.
The UI/UX design was done by Olubusolami Sogunle.
A big thank you to them all!! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜‰

Continued development
Responsiveness - This webpage doesn't meet all the responsive standards. Had a tight deadline. When I have time, I look into updating this webpage.

Hover Effect - Again, the website is in a continuous developent state. Hover effects are to be added to make it look and feel nicer.
